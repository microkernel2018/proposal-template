Microkernel2018
===============

A community project to develop a microkernel.

Building
========

Before building, you need to export some environmental variables. Specifically:
 $ export PATH="/path/to/cross/compiler:$PATH"
 $ export CC="i386-elf-gcc"

Then:
 $ make          # Build all components and install them to a sysroot directory.
 $ make iso      # Build an .iso image from the sysroot directory.
 $ make run-qemu # Boot the .iso image using qemu-system-i386.
